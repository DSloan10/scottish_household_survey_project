# Access to Green Space in Scotland

Using datasets derived from historic Scottish Household surveys, the intention of the project was to address levels of local access to green spaces among the Scottish population. In particular, the following 3 Business Questions were addressed:

1. Are there certain groups that have local access to green space? Are there groups that are lacking access?
2. Are there any differences between rural and urban areas?
3. How do people in neighbourhoods with good access to green space differ from those who have no good access? Are there differences in how they rate their neighbourhoods? Are there differences in how they rate their communities?
